# Keypirinha Plugin: quicknote_md

This is quicknote_markdown, a plugin for the [Keypirinha](http://keypirinha.com) launcher.

This is a fork of [todo-markdown](https://github.com/TimberToe/keypirinha-todo-markdown) by [TimberToe](https://github.com/TimberToe/). I just changed a few lines of code to make it suitable for writing down Notes intstead of Todos. Think of it as an extended clipboard. I use it to copy text and paste it into a mardown file for later review. This way I dont have to open the markdown editor.

A plugin to easily Add/Review/List Quick Notes in a Markdown file.

I use a markdown file to jolt down small notes over the day.
Since I use Keypirinha for everything else, why not as as shortcut to add my Notes!
